                <h3>Nanny Guarantee</h3>

                <h4>How long does will it take for you to find me a nanny?</h4>
                <p>Nannies CA strives to find the perfect nanny for your family within two weeks. If we currently have a nanny on staff that is not with a family we may be able to provide you with services sooner. If there are special qualifications that you would like your nanny to have it may take us slightly longer to provide you with a nanny.</p>

                <h4>What is your nanny screening process?</h4>
                <p>We strive to ensure that the nanny is safe, reliable, and trustworthy. To do this, Nannies CA first
                conducts a phone interview with several candidates. Next, we conduct in person interviews with the nanny
                that revolve around situations that they may encounter while interacting with your child / children. We
                also conduct criminal background checks, check for a valid driver's license, and ensure that each nanny
                has their CPR certification. We are also able to perform any additional checks at your request.</p>

                <h4>Why is my nanny paid on a weekly basis rather than an hourly one?</h4>
                <p>We believe in the importance of a child's long-term relationship with their nanny. Nannies CA has found that the predictability of the weekly payment system makes a nanny more likely to stay with a family long-term.</p>

                <h4>How does the nanny get paid?</h4>
                <p>After we find you a nanny that fits your needs you will pay them based upon the agreed upon terms. We will find someone that will work for the rate you want.</p>

                <h4>Can I meet the nanny you have chosen prior to his/her hiring?</h4>
                <p>Yes, we can customize our search process to suit your needs. We can also arrange for you to meet with several candidates. We want you to feel 100% comfortable with your family's nanny.</p>

                <h4>What happens if I am not satisfied with my nanny?</h4>
                <p>If you are not satisfied with your nanny for any reason within three months from their start date we will find you a replacement free of charge. We will notify you of the three month mark when we decide on a nanny and will also check with you one week before that mark to ensure everything is going well.</p>
