                <h4>How long does will it take for you to find me a nanny?</h4>
                <p>Nannies CA strives to find the perfect nanny for your family within two weeks. If we currently have a nanny on staff that is not with a family we may be able to provide you with services sooner. If there are special qualifications that you would like your nanny to have it may take us slightly longer to provide you with a nanny.</p>

                <h4>What is your nanny screening process?</h4>
                <p>We strive to ensure that the nanny is safe, reliable, and trustworthy. To do this, Nannies CA first conducts a phone interview with several candidates. Next, we conduct in person interviews with the nanny that revolve around situations that they may encounter while interacting with your child / children. We also conduct criminal background checks, check for a valid driver's license, and ensure that each nanny has their CPR certification. We then conduct a background check on each nanny every three months that they are employed by us to further ensure your child's safety.</p>

                <h4>Why is my nanny paid on a weekly basis rather than an hourly one?</h4>
                <p>We believe in the importance of a child's long-term relationship with their nanny. Nannies CA has found that the predictability of the weekly payment system makes a nanny more likely to stay with a family long-term.</p>
