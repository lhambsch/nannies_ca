                <h3>Our Search Process</h3>
                <p>Your child's safety is our number one priority when looking for a nanny. For this reason, we put each candidate through a thorough screening process that involves multiple interviews and background checks. 
                <ul>
                    <li>We interview multiple candidates on the phone in order to gauge whether they will be a good fit for your family.</li>
                    <li>After narrowing down our search to the top three nannies, we will then perform face to face interviews with each remaining nanny.</li>
                    <li>At this time we also ensure that each nanny has a valid and current driver's license.</li>
                    <li>We rank the final candidates and perform thorough criminal background checks on each candidate so that we can provide you with the top ranked candidate that had a clean background check.</li>
                    <li>After deciding on the perfect nanny for your family we will then arrange for them to obtain their CPR certification if they do not already have it.</li>
                    <li>In order to ensure your child's continued safety, we also perform thorough background checks on each nanny every three months.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This entire process can be modified and specialized at your request.</p>
